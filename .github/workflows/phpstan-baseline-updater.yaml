# This workflow automatically updates the PHPStan baseline if our `main` branch has errors.
# The automated update of the baseline is only needed because the PHPStan check is not (yet) required for a
# pull request. Once the check is required we can remove this workflow as no errors can be merged to the main branch
# anymore.
